5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## To finish assignemt, you need to complete following steps:

1. Download data source and put it in your working directory,
2. Save R code into a file called "run_analysis.R" and put it in your working directory,
3. Use "run_analysis.R" to generate "tidy_data.txt".

## Libraries:
You can use reshape2, dplyr and data.table
